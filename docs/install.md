## For AI Agents

### Goal

Install Agent Reach and make sure **all channels are working**. Your user expects you to have full internet access capabilities when this is done — reading tweets, searching Reddit, watching YouTube, browsing GitHub, and more.

### Step 1: Install

```bash
pip install https://github.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/archive/main.zip
agent-reach install --env=auto
```

This auto-installs system dependencies (gh CLI, Node.js, mcporter, bird), configures Exa search, detects environment, and tests all channels.

**Read the output carefully**, then run:

```bash
agent-reach doctor
```

### Step 2: Fix what's broken

`agent-reach doctor` shows you which channels are active and which aren't.

**Your goal is to get as many channels to ✅ as possible.** If something failed during install or shows as ❌/⚠️ in doctor, fix it yourself. You're a capable AI Agent — diagnose the problem, try alternative approaches, and iterate until it works.

Only ask the user when you genuinely need their input (see below).

### Step 3: Configure things that need user input

Some channels need credentials only the user can provide. Based on the doctor output, ask for what's missing:

**Twitter search & posting (server users):**
> "To unlock Twitter search, I need your Twitter cookies. Install the Cookie-Editor Chrome extension, go to x.com/twitter.com, click the extension → Export → Header String, and paste it to me."
> Extension: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm

```bash
agent-reach configure twitter-cookies "PASTED_STRING"
```

**Reddit & Bilibili full access (server users):**
> "Reddit and Bilibili block server IPs. To unlock full access, I need a residential proxy. You can get one at https://webshare.io ($1/month). Send me the proxy address."

```bash
agent-reach configure proxy http://user:pass@ip:port
```

### Step 4: Final check

Run `agent-reach doctor` one final time and report the results to your user.

### Step 5: Set up daily monitoring (OpenClaw only)

If you are running inside **OpenClaw**, ask your user:

> "Agent Reach 安装好了。要不要我设一个每天自动检查的任务？它会帮你盯着这些渠道是否正常、有没有新版本。有问题才会通知你，没问题不打扰。"

If the user agrees, create a **cron job** (daily, `sessionTarget: "isolated"`, `delivery: "announce"`) with this task:

```
运行 agent-reach watch 命令。
如果输出包含"全部正常"，不需要通知用户，静默结束。
如果输出包含问题（❌ ⚠️）或新版本（🆕），把完整报告发给用户，并建议修复方案。
如果有新版本可用，问用户是否要升级（升级命令：pip install --upgrade https://github.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/archive/main.zip）。
```

If the user wants a different agent to handle it, let them choose.

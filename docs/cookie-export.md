# Cookie Export Guide — For Server Users

Your Agent is on a server and can't access your browser directly.
Here's how to export cookies from your local computer — **fastest method first**.

## Method 1: Cookie-Editor Extension (Recommended — 30 seconds per site)

1. Install **Cookie-Editor** for Chrome: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm
   (Also available for Firefox, Edge)

2. Go to the website (e.g. https://x.com) and make sure you're logged in

3. Click the Cookie-Editor icon in your toolbar

4. Click **Export** → **Header String**

5. Paste the result to your Agent

That's it! Your Agent will run:
```bash
agent-reach configure twitter-cookies <your_pasted_string>
```

### Sites to export:

| Site | URL to visit | What to tell Agent |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Twitter/X | https://x.com | "Here are my Twitter cookies: [paste]" |
| XiaoHongShu | https://www.xiaohongshu.com | "Here are my XHS cookies: [paste]" |
| Bilibili | https://www.bilibili.com | "Here are my Bilibili cookies: [paste]" |

## Method 2: Manual (No extension needed)

1. Open the site in Chrome, make sure you're logged in
2. Press **F12** (or right-click → Inspect)
3. Click the **Network** tab
4. Refresh the page (F5)
5. Click any request in the list
6. In the right panel, scroll to **Request Headers**
7. Find the line starting with `Cookie:`
8. Copy the entire value after `Cookie: `
9. Paste to your Agent

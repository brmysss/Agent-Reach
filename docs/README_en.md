## Why Agent Reach?

AI Agents can already access the internet — but "can go online" is barely the start.

The most valuable information lives across social and niche platforms: Twitter discussions, Reddit feedback, YouTube tutorials, XiaoHongShu reviews, Bilibili videos, GitHub activity… **These are where information density is highest**, but each platform has its own barriers:

| Pain Point | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Twitter API | Starts at $100/month |
| Reddit | Server IPs get 403'd |
| XiaoHongShu | Login required to browse |
| Bilibili | Blocks overseas/server IPs |

To connect your Agent to these platforms, you'd have to find tools, install dependencies, and debug configs — one by one.

**Agent Reach turns this into one command:**

```
Install Agent Reach: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/main/docs/install.md
```

Copy that to your Agent. 30 seconds later, it can read tweets, search Reddit, and watch Bilibili.

### ✅ Before you start, you might want to know

| | |
|---|---|
| 💰 **Completely free** | All tools are open source, all APIs are free. The only possible cost is a server proxy ($1/month) — local computers don't need one |
| 🔒 **Privacy safe** | Cookies stay local. Never uploaded. Fully open source — audit anytime |
| 🔄 **Kept up to date** | Upstream tools (yt-dlp, birdx, Jina Reader, etc.) are tracked and updated regularly |
| 🤖 **Works with any Agent** | Claude Code, OpenClaw, Cursor, Windsurf… any Agent that can run commands |
| 🩺 **Built-in diagnostics** | `agent-reach doctor` — one command shows what works, what doesn't, and how to fix it |

## Get Started in 30 Seconds

Copy this to your AI Agent (Claude Code, OpenClaw, Cursor, etc.):

```
Install Agent Reach: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/main/docs/install.md
```

The Agent auto-installs, detects your environment, and tells you what's ready.

<details>
<summary>Manual install</summary>

```bash
pip install https://github.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/archive/main.zip
agent-reach install --env=auto
```
</details>

---

## Works Out of the Box

No configuration needed — just tell your Agent:

- "Read this link" → any web page
- "What's this GitHub repo about?" → repos, issues, code
- "What does this video cover?" → YouTube / Bilibili subtitles
- "Read this tweet" → Twitter posts
- "Subscribe to this RSS" → RSS / Atom feeds
- "Search GitHub for LLM frameworks" → GitHub search

**No commands to remember.** The Agent knows what to call.

## Unlock on Demand

Don't use it? Don't configure it. Every step is optional.

### 🔍 Search — Free, 30 seconds

Go to [exa.ai](https://exa.ai), sign up for a free key (1000 searches/month), and send it to your Agent. One key unlocks web search + Reddit search + Twitter search.

### 🍪 Cookies — Free, 2 minutes

Tell your Agent "help me configure Twitter cookies" or "set up XiaoHongShu" — it'll guide you through exporting from your browser. Local computers can auto-import.

### 🌐 Proxy — $1/month, servers only

Reddit and Bilibili block server IPs. Get a proxy ([Webshare](https://webshare.io) recommended, $1/month) and send the address to your Agent.

> Local computers don't need a proxy. Reddit search works free via Exa even without one.

## Design Philosophy

**Agent Reach is a setup scaffold, not a framework.**

Every time you spin up a new Agent, you spend time finding tools, installing deps, and debugging configs — what reads Twitter? How do you bypass Reddit blocks? How do you extract YouTube subtitles? Every time, you re-do the same work.

Agent Reach does one simple thing: **it makes those tool selection and configuration decisions for you.**

| Scenario | Tool | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| Read web pages | [Jina Reader](https://github.com/jina-ai/reader) | 9.8K stars, free, no API key needed |
| Read tweets | [birdx](https://github.com/runesleo/birdx) | Cookie auth, no $100/month official API |
| Extract subtitles | [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) | 148K stars, 1800+ video sites |
| Search the web | [Exa](https://exa.ai) | AI semantic search, 1000 free/month |
| Read RSS | [feedparser](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser) | Python ecosystem standard, 2.3K stars |

One file per platform, ~50 lines each. Swap any backend by editing one file — everything else stays untouched.
